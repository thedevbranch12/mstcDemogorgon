                        <p>The largest amphitheater ever built, the Colosseum is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. Constructed between 70-80 AD under emperors Vespasian and Titus, this massive arena could hold up to 80,000 spectators who gathered to watch gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and public spectacles.</p>
                        <p>Despite earthquakes and stone-robbers over the centuries, the Colosseum remains a testament to Roman engineering genius and is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</p>

                        <h3>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h3>
                        <p>The freestanding bell tower of Pisa Cathedral is famous worldwide for its unintended tilt. Construction began in 1173 and continued for nearly 200 years. The tower began leaning during construction due to soft ground on one side, and engineers have worked for centuries to prevent its collapse.</p>
                        <p>Standing 56 meters tall with 294 steps to the top, the tower leans at about 4 degrees. Visitors can climb to the top for panoramic views of the Piazza dei Miracoli.</p>

                            <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                            <p>Beyond its famous lean, the tower is a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture. Legend holds that Galileo Galilei conducted experiments on gravity by dropping balls from the tower, though this is likely apocryphal. The tower symbolizes human perseverance in completing ambitious projects despite setbacks.</p>

Julius Caesar was cremated here, Mark Antony delivered his famous funeral oration, and emperors commemorated their victories with triumphal arches.

                        <p>The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, with its magnificent dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, dominates the Florence skyline. The dome, completed in 1436, was an engineering marvel - the largest brick dome ever constructed and still the largest masonry dome in the world.</p>
                        <p>The exterior features stunning pink, white, and green marble panels, while Giotto's adjacent bell tower and the Baptistery of St. John complete the religious complex.</p>

                            <p>Brunelleschi's dome marked the beginning of Renaissance architecture and engineering. Without centering (temporary wooden supports), Brunelleschi invented new construction techniques that had been lost since Roman times. The cathedral symbolizes Florence's cultural and economic golden age.</p>

                        <p>St. Mark's Basilica houses the relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist and showcases over 8,000 square meters of stunning gold-ground mosaics.</p>
